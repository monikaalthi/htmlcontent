<p>n 1981 he started to help his father Dhirubhai Ambani run their family business, Reliance Industries Limited. By this time, it had already expanded so that it also dealt in refining and petrochemicals. The business also included products and services in the retail and telecommunications industries. Reliance Retail Ltd., another subsidiary, is also the largest retailer in India.[24] Reliance's Jio has earned a top-five spot[further explanation needed] in the country's telecommunication services since its public launch on 5 September 2016.

As of 2016, Ambani was ranked as the 36th richest person in the world, and has consistently held the title of India's richest person on Forbes magazine's list for the past ten years.[25] He is the only Indian businessman on Forbes' list of the world's most powerful people.[26] As of October 2020, Mukesh Ambani was ranked by Forbes as the 6th-wealthiest person in the world.[27] He surpassed Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, to become Asia's richest person with a net worth of $44.3 billion in July 2018. He is also the wealthiest person in the world outside North America and Europe.[28] As of 2015, Ambani ranked fifth among India's philanthropists, according to China's Hurun Research Institute.[29] He was appointed as a Director of Bank of America and became the first non-American to be on its board.[30]

Through Reliance, he also owns the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians and is the founder of the Indian Super League, a football league in India.[31] In 2012, Forbes named him one of the richest sports owners in the world.[32] He resides at the Antilia, one of the world's most expensive private residences with its value reaching $1 billion.[10]</p>

Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise.[22] His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.[18]

Ambani has been quoted as saying that he was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are "the kind of professors who made you think out of the box."[22]</p>

They live in Antilia, a private 27-storey building in Mumbai, which was valued at US$1 billion and was the most expensive private residence in the world at the time it was built.[10][77] The building requires a staff of 600 for maintenance, and it includes three helipads, a 160-car garage, private movie theater, swimming pool, and fitness center.[78]

In 2007, Ambani gifted his wife a $60 million Airbus A319 for her 44th birthday.[79] The Airbus, which has a capacity of 180 passengers, has been custom-fitted to include a living room, bedroom, satellite television, WiFi, sky bar, Jacuzzi, and an office.[80]

Ambani was titled "The World's Richest Sports Team Owner" after his purchase of the IPL cricket team Mumbai Indians for $111.9 million in 2008.[81][82]

Mukesh Ambani is a strict vegetarian and teetotaler.[83]

During the fiscal year ending 31 March 2012, he reportedly decided to forgo nearly ₹240 million from his annual pay as chief of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). He elected to do this even as RIL's total remuneration packages to its top management personnel increased during that fiscal year. Mukesh Ambani holds a 50.4% stake in the company.[84] This move kept his salary capped at ₹150 million for the fourth year in a row.[85]

In early 2019, a court in Mumbai held his younger brother, Anil Ambani, in criminal contempt for non-payment of personally guaranteed debt Reliance Communications owed to Swedish gearmaker Ericsson. Instead of jail time, the court gave Anil a month to come up with the funds. At the end of the month, Mukesh bailed out his younger brother, paying the debt.[40] In 2021, he was the subject of a bomb scare when a green Mahindra Scorpio SUV packed with explosives was found near a Mumbai skyscraper housing Ambani.[86]</p>
